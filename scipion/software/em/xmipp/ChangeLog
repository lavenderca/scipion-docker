2.5

- FFTW updated to 3.2.2
- Added Entropy Otsu segmentation to xmipp_volume_segment
- Added -min, -max, -which_min, -which_max to xmipp_operate
- Speed up of xmipp_mpi_class_averages
- Better estimations of energy in xmipp_detect_structures
- Bug fix in xmipp_detect_missing_wedge
- Differential Evolution (de_solver in /data) now uses Xmipp's own Random
generator, seems to solve a problem with heap corruption.

- 3D Morphological sharpening added to xmipp_morphology
- xmipp_angular_assign_for_tilt_series is more robust and faster
- xmipp_fourier_filter accepts now Gaussians defined in real space
- xmipp_convert_vol2pseudo now works with a different algorithm more precise
- Bug fix in preprocess_micrographs protocol when downsampling=1
- xmipp_sort_images added
- xmipp_analyze_cluster added
